## Designer Tool
Designer Tool is a desktop application that written in Electron j's. <br/>
It's written by me from scratch to our Designers in Techfinancials. <br/>
With this app you can load html and css files and inject functionality to the DOM with very friendly UI. <br/>
it also let you edit each element as you want without needed understanding css or html code. <br/>
Behind the seen the app read all the css and html files and splits them into groups based on the css blocks and create a huge object that we can manipulate with it.  <br/>
It's read all the properties of each element and based on the information from the object it offer you the edit the elements. <br/>
after the user finish to work he can generate basiclly a new skin/copy from his website. <br/>
