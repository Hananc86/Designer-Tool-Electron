## Designer Tool
Designer Tool is a desktop application that written in Electron j's.
It's written by me from scratch to our Designers in Techfinancials.
With this app you can load html and css files and inject functionality to the DOM with very friendly UI.
it also let you edit each element as you want without needed understanding css or html code.
Behind the seen the app read all the css and html files and splits them into groups based on the css blocks and create a huge object that we can manipulate with it. 
It's read all the properties of each element and based on the information from the object it offer you the edit the elements.
